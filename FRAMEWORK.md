## 🎯 Best Practices for Claude

### Before Starting Any Project
1. **Always check** for existing sessions first
2. **Use smart questioning** - let the framework detect project type
3. **Trust auto-completion** - it's based on current market research
4. **Don't skip quality loop** - it ensures professional standards

### During PRD Creation
1. **Answer contextual questions** thoroughly but concisely
2. **Review tech stack suggestions** before accepting
3. **Validate estimates** against project scope
4. **Use Context7 research** for current trends

### During Task Generation
1. **Let Context7 validate** tech stack patterns
2. **Check complexity classification** is accurate
3. **Ensure cross-validation** with PRD passes
4. **Verify task granularity** (8-40 hours per task)

### During Execution
1. **Trust the iterative process** - let it run its course
2. **Don't bypass quality checks** - they prevent technical debt
3. **Document any manual interventions** needed
4. **Ensure quality certification** before declaring complete

### Before Any Code Changes
1. **Always explain first** - Provide short, concise explanation of what the change does
2. **State the purpose** - Why this change is needed or beneficial
3. **Describe the impact** - What will be different after the change
4. **Then implement** - Only proceed with code after explanation is given

---

## 🚨 Error Handling & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Session ID collisions:** Framework auto-resolves
- **Context7 research failures:** Graceful fallback to cached patterns
- **Quality loop timeout:** Manual improvement plan generated
- **MCP Playwright issues:** Verify installation and permissions

### Emergency Commands
```bash
# Reset session if corrupted
./ai-dev reset {session-id}

# Force manual quality review
./ai-dev heal {session-id} --manual

# Export session for debugging
./ai-dev export {session-id}
```

## 🔄 Git Workflow Guidelines

### Mandatory Git Practices (ALWAYS follow)
1. **Commit after each major milestone** - PRD creation, task generation, phase completion
2. **Proactive commit reminders** - Assistant MUST remind user to commit after completing significant work
3. **Conventional commit format** - Use: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`
4. **Session traceability** - Include session-id in commit messages for perfect tracking
5. **Backup frequency** - Push to remote after each completed workflow phase

### Commit Timing Requirements
- **After PRD creation** - `feat: add PRD for {session-id} {project-name}`
- **After task generation** - `feat: add task breakdown for {session-id} {project-name}`
- **After each implementation phase** - `feat: complete phase {N} for {session-id}`
- **After quality certification** - `feat: achieve quality certification for {session-id}`
- **Before session end** - `docs: finalize session {session-id} documentation`

### Assistant Behavior Rules
1. **ALWAYS remind** user to commit after completing any file generation
2. **Suggest specific** commit messages following conventional format
3. **Include session-id** in all suggested commit messages
4. **Recommend push** to remote after major milestones
5. **Never assume** Git is configured - always check and guide setup if needed

### Git Setup Validation
```bash
# Check if Git is initialized
git status

# If not initialized, guide user through:
git init
git add .
git commit -m "feat: initialize project with framework files"

# For remote backup (optional but recommended):
git remote add origin <repository-url>
git push -u origin main
```

### Example Workflow Integration
```bash
# 1. Create PRD
./ai-dev create
# → Assistant: "Great! Now let's commit this PRD: git add . && git commit -m 'feat: add PRD for {session-id} {project-name}'"

# 2. Generate tasks  
./ai-dev generate 01_prd_{session-id}_{project-name}.md
# → Assistant: "Task generation complete! Let's save this progress: git add . && git commit -m 'feat: add task breakdown for {session-id} {project-name}'"

# 3. Execute phases
./ai-dev execute 02_tasks_{session-id}_{project-name}.md
# → Assistant: "Phase 1 complete! Time to commit: git add . && git commit -m 'feat: complete phase 1 foundation for {session-id}'"
```

---

## 📊 Execution Tracking System

### Mandatory Task Completion Reporting
Every execution session MUST maintain real-time progress tracking through the execution report file.

### **Report File Creation (MANDATORY)**
```
03_report_{session-id}_{project-name}.md
```

**When to create:** Immediately upon starting task execution (before first task)  
**When to update:** After EVERY single task completion  
**Format:** Structured markdown with checkboxes and progress tracking

### **Required Report Structure**
```markdown
# Project Execution Report
**Project:** {project-name}
**Session ID:** {session-id}
**Started:** {inicio}
**Last Updated:** {timestamp actual}
**Framework:** AI Development Framework v3.1.1

- Development example: `feat: complete task 1.2 and update execution tracking for {session-id}`
- Quality example: `feat: complete QA-3 scoring and update quality tracking for {session-id}`
- Final example: `feat: achieve quality certification and finalize project {session-id}`

### **Quality Gates for Execution Tracking**
- **No development task completion** without report update
- **No quality task completion** without quality section update
- **No phase advancement** without updated progress summary for ALL phases
- **No development completion** without starting Phase 6 (Quality Loop)
- **No session completion** without 100% development AND quality completion
- **No production deployment** without quality certification achieved (8/10+ all dimensions)
- **Mandatory final commit** including complete execution report with quality certification

### **Error Prevention**
- Validate report file exists before starting any task
- Verify task completion is reflected in report before moving to next
- Cross-check task count in report matches task file
- Ensure progress percentages are mathematically correct

## ✅ Task Completion Validation System

### CRITICAL: Definition of Done (DoD) Requirements
**Purpose:** Prevent false completion reporting  
**Enforcement:** MANDATORY before marking any task as complete

### **Universal DoD Criteria (ALL tasks must meet these)**
1. **Functional Requirement Met** - The specific deliverable exists and works
2. **Acceptance Criteria Satisfied** - All task requirements fulfilled completely  
3. **Dependencies Resolved** - No blockers remain for subsequent tasks
4. **Validation Evidence** - Proof of completion available (files, screenshots, tests)
5. **Integration Verified** - Works correctly with existing project components

### **Task-Type Specific DoD Criteria**

#### **Development Tasks**
- [ ] **Code Written** - All required code implemented
- [ ] **Code Tested** - Manual verification or automated tests pass
- [ ] **Code Documented** - Comments and documentation added where needed
- [ ] **Dependencies Installed** - All required packages/libraries working
- [ ] **Integration Working** - New code integrates with existing codebase
- [ ] **No Breaking Changes** - Existing functionality still works

#### **Configuration Tasks**
- [ ] **Configuration Applied** - Settings actually changed in target system
- [ ] **Configuration Tested** - New settings work as expected
- [ ] **Backup Created** - Previous configuration saved if needed
- [ ] **Documentation Updated** - Configuration changes documented
- [ ] **Permissions Set** - Correct access rights applied

#### **File/Content Creation Tasks**
- [ ] **File Created** - Target file exists at specified location
- [ ] **Content Complete** - All required content included
- [ ] **Format Correct** - File format and structure as specified
- [ ] **Permissions Set** - File accessible to required users/systems
- [ ] **Content Validated** - Content quality checked and approved

#### **Setup/Installation Tasks**
- [ ] **Software Installed** - Target software successfully installed
- [ ] **Installation Verified** - Software runs without errors
- [ ] **Dependencies Met** - All prerequisites satisfied
- [ ] **Configuration Applied** - Initial setup completed
- [ ] **Functionality Tested** - Basic operations work correctly

### **Mandatory Validation Protocol**

#### **Before Marking ANY Task Complete - MUST Execute:**

```markdown
## 🔍 Task Completion Validation Checklist

**Task ID:** [X.Y]
**Task Description:** [Brief description]
**Attempted Completion Date:** [Timestamp]

### Step 1: Universal DoD Verification
- [ ] Functional requirement met
- [ ] Acceptance criteria satisfied  
- [ ] Dependencies resolved
- [ ] Validation evidence exists
- [ ] Integration verified

### Step 2: Task-Type Specific DoD
[Use appropriate checklist from above]

### Step 3: Evidence Documentation
**Proof of Completion:**
- [ ] Screenshot/file evidence attached
- [ ] Testing results documented
- [ ] Error logs reviewed (if applicable)
- [ ] Dependencies verified working

### Step 4: Final Validation Decision
**DECISION:** 
- [ ] ✅ COMPLETE - All DoD criteria met, task genuinely finished
- [ ] 🔄 BLOCKED - Cannot complete due to impediment (use impediment protocol)
- [ ] ❌ FAILED - Attempted but unable to satisfy requirements

**IF NOT COMPLETE:** Task remains marked as [ ] and impediment is reported
**IF COMPLETE:** Task can be marked as [x] and logged with evidence
```

### **Impediment Resolution Protocol - Flexible Approach**

#### **Core Principle: Always Try Before Escalating**

#### **When Tasks Cannot Be Completed:**

```markdown
## 🚫 Task Impediment Report

**Task ID:** [X.Y]
**Task Description:** [Brief description]
**Impediment Discovered:** [Timestamp]

### Impediment Classification
**Type:** [Technical/Dependency/Resource/Knowledge]
**Description:** [Detailed explanation of what's blocking completion]
**Complexity Assessment:** [Simple/Moderate/Complex/Expert-Level]
**Impact:** [How this affects the project timeline]

### Resolution Attempts (Adaptive Approach)
**Minimum Required:** Try at least 2 different approaches before escalating

**Attempt 1:** [Approach description] - Result: [Success/Partial/Failed - explain]
**Attempt 2:** [Different approach] - Result: [Success/Partial/Failed - explain]
**Attempt 3:** [If needed] - Result: [Success/Partial/Failed - explain]

### Adaptive Resolution Strategy
**For Simple Issues (5-15 min effort):**
- [ ] Quick research: Check docs/common solutions
- [ ] Try obvious alternative approach
- [ ] If no progress → escalate with clear description

**For Moderate Issues (15-30 min effort):**
- [ ] Research multiple approaches online
- [ ] Try 2-3 different implementation methods
- [ ] Break down into smaller sub-problems
- [ ] If significant progress → continue; if stuck → escalate

**For Complex Issues (30+ min potential):**
- [ ] Assess if this is core to project success
- [ ] If YES: Invest more time with systematic approaches
- [ ] If NO: Look for simpler alternatives or workarounds
- [ ] Document findings and escalate with research done

### Smart Escalation
**When to Escalate (ANY of these conditions):**
- [ ] No progress after reasonable attempts (15-30 min typically)
- [ ] Issue requires expertise clearly outside AI knowledge
- [ ] Problem is environmental/access-related
- [ ] Multiple similar approaches all fail for same reason
- [ ] Solution would take longer than implementing different approach

**Escalation Information:**
**Specific Help Needed:** [Be very clear about what's needed]
**What Was Tried:** [Brief summary of attempts]
**Why It's Blocked:** [Root cause if identified]
**Suggested Next Steps:** [What human should try]

### Resolution Outcome
**Final Status:** 
- [ ] ✅ RESOLVED - [How it was solved]
- [ ] 🔄 WORKAROUND - [Alternative approach used]
- [ ] 🆘 ESCALATED - [Awaiting human help]
- [ ] 🔀 DEFERRED - [Will revisit later]

**If Resolved:**
**Solution:** [What actually worked]
**Time Invested:** [Rough time spent]
**Key Insight:** [What made the difference]
```

#### **Flexible Assistant Behavior Guidelines**

##### **Smart Decision Making:**
1. **Assess impediment complexity** realistically
2. **Match effort to importance** - core features get more time
3. **Know when to pivot** - try alternatives vs banging head on wall
4. **Escalate intelligently** - with useful context, not just "it's broken"

##### **Effort Guidelines (Not Strict Rules):**
- **Quick fixes:** 5-10 minutes of attempts
- **Standard issues:** 15-30 minutes before considering escalation
- **Critical path items:** Up to 45 minutes if making progress
- **Nice-to-have features:** 15 minutes max, then find alternatives

##### **Resolution Mindset:**
- **Goal:** Make project progress, not perfect solutions
- **Acceptable:** Working alternatives that meet core requirements
- **Preferred:** Document learnings for future similar issues
- **Smart:** Balance time investment with project priorities
```

### **Assistant Behavior Enforcement**

#### **NEVER Allow These Actions:**
1. ❌ Marking task complete without DoD validation
2. ❌ Moving to next task while previous task blocked
3. ❌ Reporting "attempted" as "completed"
4. ❌ Skipping impediment reporting when blocked
5. ❌ Making assumptions about task success without evidence

#### **ALWAYS Require These Actions:**
1. ✅ Complete DoD checklist before marking any task done
2. ✅ Document evidence of successful completion
3. ✅ Report impediments immediately when discovered
4. ✅ Verify dependencies are satisfied before advancing
5. ✅ Update execution report with accurate status only

### **Quality Gates**
- **No task marked complete** without passing DoD validation
- **No phase advancement** with any blocked tasks unresolved
- **No session completion** with any false completions
- **Mandatory impediment review** before any workarounds

## 🤖 AI Model Compatibility Guidelines

### Cross-Platform Tool Usage
Different AI models have different tool interfaces. The framework must accommodate these differences.

### **Claude Code Specific Tools**
- **Edit/Replace Commands:** Native support for find-and-replace operations
- **MultiEdit:** Batch editing capabilities
- **Tool Integration:** Full MCP integration available

### **Gemini CLI Compatibility Issues**
- **Replace Command FAILS:** Gemini does not support Claude Code's `replace` command
- **Alternative Required:** Must use different file editing approach
- **Tool Limitations:** Some Claude Code tools may not be available

### **Gemini CLI Workarounds**

#### **For File Editing (Replace replace command):**
```markdown
**INSTEAD OF:** Using replace command
**USE:** Manual file recreation approach

1. Read entire file content
2. Create new version with modifications  
3. Write complete new file content
4. Verify changes applied correctly

**Example Process:**
- Read current file: "Show me the current content of file.js"
- Manual editing: "Create new version with X changed to Y"
- Write new file: "Create file.js with this new content: [full content]"
```

#### **For Multi-File Operations:**
```markdown
**INSTEAD OF:** Batch operations
**USE:** Sequential individual file operations

1. Process one file at a time
2. Verify each change before proceeding
3. Commit changes incrementally
4. Maintain detailed log of modifications
```

### **AI Model Detection Protocol**
```markdown
**At Session Start - ALWAYS identify AI model being used:**

**For Claude:** 
- "I'm using Claude Code with full tool support"
- Use standard Edit/MultiEdit/Replace commands
- Full MCP integration available

**For Gemini:**
- "I'm using Gemini CLI with limited tool support"  
- Use manual file recreation for editing
- Alternative approaches for file operations
- Extra validation steps required

**For Other Models:**
- Identify tool capabilities early
- Test critical operations before proceeding
- Document working alternatives
- Add new compatibility guidelines
```

### **Mandatory Tool Compatibility Checks**
```markdown
**Before Starting Any File Operations:**

1. **Test Edit Capability**
   - Claude: Use Edit tool on test file
   - Gemini: Use manual file recreation test
   - Others: Identify working method

2. **Verify MCP Access**
   - Test Context7 research capability
   - Test Playwright integration
   - Document any limitations

3. **Establish Workflow**
   - Define file editing approach
   - Set validation procedures
   - Create fallback methods
```

### **Error Prevention for Tool Incompatibility**
- **Always identify AI model** at session start
- **Test critical tools** before beginning project work
- **Use model-appropriate** editing methods
- **Document workarounds** for future reference
- **Validate all changes** regardless of editing method used

### **Quality Assurance Regardless of AI Model**
- **Same DoD validation** applies to all models
- **Same tracking requirements** for all assistants
- **Same quality thresholds** (8/10+) for all projects
- **Tool differences don't affect** final quality standards

## 🧠 Error Memory System

### Framework Learning & Continuous Improvement
The framework includes a sophisticated error memory system to ensure continuous improvement and prevent recurring issues.

### **Core Memory Files**
- **KNOWN_ISSUES.md** - Complete database of discovered bugs, solutions, and prevention measures
- **FRAMEWORK.md** - This file, updated with lessons learned
- **Session logs** - Individual project experiences and outcomes

### **Error Memory Protocol for AI Assistants**

#### **1. Always Start with Memory Check**
```bash
# Before any framework operation:
1. Read KNOWN_ISSUES.md completely
2. Identify any relevant known issues
3. Apply documented solutions proactively
4. Watch for symptoms of documented problems
```

#### **2. Proactive Error Prevention**
- **Validate assumptions** - Never assume features work as documented
- **Test critical paths** - Verify Git setup, MCP tools, file permissions
- **Cross-reference docs** - Ensure README promises match implementation
- **Apply known workarounds** - Use documented solutions immediately

#### **3. Real-Time Issue Documentation**
When encountering ANY new problem:
```markdown
### ISSUE-XXX: [Brief Description]

## 📚 Critical Lessons Learned - Session 720512

### ⚠️ MAJOR FRAMEWORK INSIGHT: Technical Quality ≠ User Quality
**Date:** 2025-07-21  
**Project:** WUPOS POS System  
**Critical Discovery:** Framework passed all technical tests but missed critical usability failures

#### The Problem:
- **Technical Quality Assessment:** 8/10+ scores achieved ✅
- **Real User Experience:** 3/10 - System completely unusable ❌
- **Gap:** Automated tests validated technical implementation but missed human usability

#### What Technical Tests Validated (But Wasn't Enough):
```
✅ CSS properties loaded correctly
✅ React components rendering  
✅ Accessibility elements present in DOM
✅ Responsive breakpoints technically working
✅ Color contrast calculated as sufficient
```

#### What Technical Tests Missed (Critical User Reality):
```
❌ Text fields only 30px wide - illegible
❌ Labels truncated ("Fi", "Li", "Email ad")  
❌ Buttons 20px height - unusable on touch
❌ 70% of screen space completely wasted
❌ Real users cannot operate the interface
```

#### FRAMEWORK ENHANCEMENT - MANDATORY HUMAN VALIDATION:

**NEW STEP: Add Product Manager Review After Technical Quality**

```markdown
## Phase 6.5: MANDATORY Human Usability Review
**WHEN:** After technical quality assessment passes
**WHO:** Product Manager perspective (AI assumes this role)
**HOW:** 
1. Take screenshots of actual interface
2. Evaluate as real user would experience it
3. Check for practical workflow usability  
4. Verify business requirements fulfillment
5. Score /10 from user perspective
6. BLOCK deployment if score < 7/10

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- Text legible at normal viewing distance
- Interactive elements >44px for touch
- Screen space utilization >80%
- Real workflow scenarios possible
- Business user can complete tasks efficiently
```

#### Critical Success Factors Added to Framework:

**For POS/Business Systems:**
- **Design System Mandate:** MUST use DaisyUI framework for all UI components
- **Research Method:** Use MCP Context7 to access latest DaisyUI patterns
- **Component Standards:** Only DaisyUI components allowed (`btn-lg`, `input-lg`, etc.)
- **Professional Theming:** Use business-appropriate themes (`corporate`, `business`)
- **Touch Compatibility:** DaisyUI large variants ensure 44px+ minimum
- **Accessibility:** DaisyUI components are WCAG compliant by default
- **Screen Utilization:** Use DaisyUI grid system for 90%+ viewport usage
- **Workflow Optimization:** Design for speed and business efficiency
- **Real User Testing:** Validate with actual business scenarios

#### DaisyUI Implementation Protocol:
```bash
# MANDATORY: Install DaisyUI for all UI projects
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer daisyui

# MANDATORY: Research via Context7 before implementation
# Use MCP Context7 to get latest DaisyUI patterns for specific use case

# MANDATORY: Configure professional theme
# Use corporate/business themes for professional applications
```

#### Framework Update Summary:
```bash
# NEW COMMAND: Add human validation step
./ai-dev validate-human {session-id}

# Enhanced quality command includes human review
./ai-dev iterate quality {session-id} --include-human-review
```

---

**Remember:** This framework is designed to deliver professional-quality results efficiently. The addition of mandatory human validation ensures we deliver not just technically correct, but genuinely usable solutions. Trust the process, use the automation, but ALWAYS validate from the human user perspective before deployment.
